Ergonomic keyboard layout based on [[https://bepo.fr][Bépo]]. This layout focuses on seamless
integration with english and programming.

** Installation

*** XKB Install

Instalation for [[https://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/][XKB for Xorg]].

Copy content of =xkb= folder in your =$HOME= directory.

Run the following script for using the layout.

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/sh

setxkbmap -I $HOME/.xkb prbeop-fren -print | xkbcomp -I$HOME/.xkb - $DISPLAY 2> /dev/null
xmodmap $HOME/.xkb/xmodmap 2> $HOME/i3-keyboard-log
exit 0
#+end_src

*** OSX Install

The =OSX= folder contains a [[https://software.sil.org/ukelele/][Ukulele]] layout and a [[https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/][Karabiner]] config

** Rationale

The bepo layout is great for french word processing and long text entry, but it
does not correspond to all computer uses. I mostly use my keyboard for
programming, system administration and english writing.

I moved common english letters and specific keys, not often used in natural
language (braces { and }, brackets [ and ], chevrons < and >) to more accessible
positions.

** Usage

This layout makes extensive use of modifiers to access the keys often used on
the most accessible positions.

In particular,

- Keys used in programming (#, $, <>, [], {}, !, ...) are more accessible
  and pairs are grouped.
- Facilitate rolling on common vowel groups for french (au, eu, ou, ai, ei, oi,
  ie...).
- Easier access to typographic characters: (‘, «, », “, ”, …, ·)
- Some dead keys are used in programming and in language like ~ or ` and have
  both the modifier and the standalone character.
- Modifier for monetary symbols (¤ + l = £, ¤ + b = ₿, etc) and greek (μ + a =
  α, μ + l = λ, …).

** Modifiers

The modifier set up is not included in the layout and can be software dependent
but I try to use
- =Ctrl= key in place of =Alt= (like in OSX) for easier shortcuts.
- Symmetrical =AltGr= (or mod key for characters like <> and []).
- A right modifier for window manager shortcuts (eg [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]]).
- =Caps Lock= is remaped to a new modifier (eg =Hyper=) for custom shortcuts in
  editors: Emacs can use four different modifiers (C, M, H, S)
